Performing a Software Update on the Device

Allow the device to start up.
On main screen of the device, Select ‘Exit’, then ‘Exit’ again. This will take you to the command line on the device.

Either SSH in or use a USB Keyboard. SSH will require a little bit of setup.

SSH:
In your command line, type “ssh pi@[insert IP Address here]"
If prompted, type “yes”
Enter password: “granustem”
Hit the ‘control’ and ‘C’ keys to interrupt the boot up process.

You are now in the device and can use the following git commands as you wish.


git checkout [branch name] - This command is used to switch between branches in the GitHub repository.

git pull - This command will get the latest updates from GitHub for the current branch and update them on the device.

git branch - List the branches of the GitHub repository available. An indicator will show which branch is currently checked out.


The software can be rebooted by typing ‘python3 main.py’ into the command line while in the ~/FIELDAQ/Granusoft/src directory.
